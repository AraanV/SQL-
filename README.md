"# SQL-" 

This project is a sample student management database that stores university student information, teacher information, courses, and grades. Utilizing Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, this database was developed by first creating an entity-relationship diagram to map out the necessary entities, attributes, and their relationship. Every part of this project shows how to do the following: 

* Write queries like JOINS, Wildcards, Nested Queries, UNION, WHERE, ORDER BY, and TRIGGERS.
* Use SELECT statement to view the created tables

The tables were created automatically using the Microsoft SQL Server GUI. Primary and foreign keys were set using this feature.
