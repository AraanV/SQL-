"# SQL-" 

This project is a sample student management database that stores university student information, teacher information, courses, and grades. Utilizing Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, this database was developed by first drawing an entity-relationship diagram to map out the necessary entities, attributes, and their relationship. Every part of this project shows how to do the following: 

* Write queries like JOINS, Wildcards, Nested Queries, UNION, WHERE, ORDER BY
* Create TRIGGERS when inserting new data into the table
* Use SELECT statement to view the created tables

The tables were created automatically using the Microsoft SQL Server GUI. Primary and foreign keys were set using this feature. Attached is the sample data:
